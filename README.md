# KGP_RISC_PROCESSOR

Verilog files for the implementation of the KGP-RISC Processor during the Computer Organization Lab Project. The design documentation is present in [documentation/](./documentation). The assembly ".s" test files and their corresponding binary ".coe" files are in [test_bench](./test_bench/). The [assembler](./assembler.cpp) generates the .coe files from the .s files.
